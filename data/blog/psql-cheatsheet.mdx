# PostgreSQL

Small cheatsheet of a crash posgreSQL course.

### SQL Shell Comands.

- \q = showcase all the commands
- \! cls = clear command line
- psql -- help
- \q = quit
- \l = show list of databases
- \d = inside of a db it shows the different tables
- \d {table name} = more info of a table
- \c {dbname} = connect to database or switch

Doc to sql types = https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/datatype.html

### CREATION 

- CREATE DATABASE {name}; = create database.
- DROP DATABASE {name}; = delete database.
- CREATE TABLE {tablename} ({columnName} {datatype} !{constraint}); = create table.
- DROP TABLE {tablename}; = delete table.

**EJ: CREATE TABLE person ( id INT, first_name VARCHAR(50), last_name VARCHAR(50), gender VARCHAR(7), date_of_birth DATE );**

**EJ WITH CONSTRAINTS : CREATE TABLE person ( id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, gender VARCHAR(6) NOT NULL, email VARCHAR(150) )*;**

### INSERT

- INSERT into person ({columnName}) VALUES({valName}); = inser data into table.

**EJ: INSERT INTO person (first_name, last_name, gender, date_of_birth) VALUES ('Anne', 'Smith', 'FEMALE', date '1988-01-09');**

### SELECT

- SELECT * FROM {table}; = get everything from table.
- SELECT {column} FROM {table}; = get column data from a table.

**EJ: SELECT first_name, last_name FROM {person};**

### SORTING (ORDER BY)

- SELECT * FROM person ORDER BY country_of_birth *default is ASC !== DESC*
- SELECT * FROM person ORDER BY id, email;

### DISTINCT 

- SELECT DISTINCT country_of_birth FROM person ORDER BY countr_of_birth *DISTINCT remove duplicate*

### WHERE (filter)

- SELECT * FROM person WHERE gender = 'Female';
- SELECT * FROM person WHERE gender = 'Male' AND country_of_birth = 'Argentina';
- SELECT * FROM person WHERE gender = 'Male' AND (country_of_birth = 'Argentina' OR country_of_birth = 'Brazil');

### LIMIT OFFSET and FETCH

- SELECT * FROM person LIMIT 10;
- SELECT * FROM person OFFSET 5 = GET FROM 6 ONWARDS;
- SELECT * FROM person OFFSET 5 LIMIT 5; = GET FROM 6 UP TO 10;

### BETWEEN

- SELECT * FROM person WHERE date_of_birth BETWEEN DATE '2000-01-01' AND '2015-01-01';

### LIKE (follow pattern)

- SELECT * FROM person WHERE email LIKE '%.com';
- SELECT * FROM person WHERE email LIKE '%@bloomberg.%'; % stands for any
- SELECT * FROM person WHERE email LIKE '____@bloomberg.%'; 4 chars before @

### GROUP BY

We need to specify the count fn to group the numbers of people from each country.

- SELECT country_of_birth, COUNT(*) FROM person GROUP BY country_of_birth;

### HAVING ( condition at least by )

- SELECT country_of_birth, COUNT(*) FROM person GROUP BY country_of_birth HAVING COUNT(*) > 5 ORDER BY country_of_birth;

### MAX, MIN, & AVG FN

- SELECT MAX(price) FROM car;
- SELECT ROUND(AVG(price)) FROM car;

### SUM FN

- SELECT SUM(price) FROM car;
- SELECT make, SUM(price) FROM car GROUP BY make;

### ARITMETIC

last arg of ROUND is decimal places.

- SELECT id, make, model, price, ROUND(price * .10, 2) FROM car; 
- SELECT id, make, model, price, ROUND(price * .10, 2), ROUND(price - (price * .10), 2) FROM car;

### ALIAS (set a name to new or existing columns)

- SELECT id, make, model, price AS origina_price, ROUND(price * .10, 2) AS ten_percent, ROUND(price - (price * .10), 2) AS discount_after_10_percent FROM car;

### COALESCE

We want to select all the people that have no email and return a default value.

- SELECT COALEASCE (email, 'Email not provided') FROM person;

### NULLIF 

Takes 2 args, returns the first arg if the second arg is not equal to the first.

### EXTRACT

- SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM NOW());
- SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM NOW());
- SELECT EXTRACT(DAT FROM NOW());

### AGE FN

- SELECT first_name, last_name, gender, country_of_birth, AGE(NOW(), date_of_birth) AS age FROM person;

### ALTER TABLE (MODIFY TABLE)

- ALTER TABLE person DROP CONSTRAINT person_pkey; --DELETE PRIMARY KEY
- ALTER TABLE person ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);

### UNIQUE CONSTRAINTS

- ALTER TABLE person ADD CONSTRAINT unique_email_address UNIQUE (email);

### CHECK CONSTRAINTS (match values)

- ALTER TABLE person ADD CONSTRAIN gender_constraint CHECK (gender = 'Female' OR gender = 'Male');

### DELETE RECORD

- DELETE FROM person WHERE id = 1;

### UPDATE RECORD

- UPDATE person SET email = 'yareyare@gmail.com' WHERE id = 2011;

### ON CONFLICT (only works on unique columns and has a constraint)

- INSERT INTO person (id) VALUES (id *that already exist*) ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING; *has no effect*
- INSERT INTO person (id) VALUES (id *that already exist*) ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET email = EXCLUDED.email; *changes the email anyway*

### RELATIONSHIP FOREIGN KEY

*name of column* BIGINT REFERENCES *table* (*column table*),
car_id BIGINT REFERENCES car (id),

### INNER JOINS (combine tables A + B = C *if has same row values*)

- SELECT * FROM person JOIN car ON person.car_id = car.id;
- YOU CAN SELECT COLUMNS AND NOT ONLY * EVERYTHING *
- YOU CAN USE THE KWORD USING

### LEFT JOINS (combine everything even if they don't match, and have relationship foreign key or NOT)

- SELECT * FROM person LEFT JOIN car ON car.id = person.car_ID

### INSTALL EXTENSION

- CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
- select * from pg_available_extensions; to see em
- \df search for functions"

### EXPORT TO CSV

- \copy (SELECT * FROM person LEFT JOIN car ON car.id = person.car_id) TO '/Users/Ivan/Desktop/results.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
